 # Spotify clone

 This is a basic Spotify Clone built using HTML and CSS. The project replicates the UI of Spotify, featuring a sleek design with a navbar, sidebar, and a music player section. It includes visually appealing elements such as album covers, song lists, and playback controls. However, this version is not responsive, meaning it may not adapt well to different screen sizes.

This project serves as a great practice for frontend development, focusing on layout structuring, styling, and positioning using CSS. Future improvements can include adding responsiveness with media queries and enhancing functionality with JavaScript.
